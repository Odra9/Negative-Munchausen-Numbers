Munchausen numebers are defined as natural numbers which are equal to the sum of all their digits raised each to the power of themselves
For fun and as an experiment I defined "Negative Munchausen numbers" as Negative integers with an absolute value equale to the absolute value of the sum of all their digits, as negatives, raised each to the power of themselves

This repository contains both an algoritm written in c++ to search this kind of numbers as well as a python script to check these findings

Usage of check.py:
execute in the terminal the following: python3 check.py <number to check>
